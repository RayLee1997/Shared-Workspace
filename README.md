This file provides context about this Obsidian vault for AI agents.

## Vault Overview

This vault is a sophisticated personal knowledge base and engineering workspace for Ray, a technical professional operating at the intersection of AI engineering, cloud infrastructure, and global finance.

It functions as a hybrid environment for managing active software development projects (specifically the **Heimdall** Discord bot, **PersonaPlex** iOS app, and **OpenClaw** hybrid cloud deployment), conducting deep investment research (Microsoft FY2026, Tesla, Meta), and documenting personal intellectual exploration into history, philosophy, and geopolitical investigations (e.g., Myanmar fraud syndicates). The content reflects a high-tech workflow in early 2026, combining practical engineering tasks with macro-economic analysis and creative projects.

## Organization

The vault utilizes a numbered folder system (00-99) based on the Johnny Decimal method to separate input, active projects, and reference materials:

- **Input & Processing**: `00_Inbox` is the active staging area, currently heavy with early 2026 research on PersonaPlex architecture, NVIDIA GPU evolution, and Anthropic/GCP integration.
- **Active Domains**: `01_Research` (Heimdall bot), `02_Ideas` (History and personal essays), `03_Productions` (Creative scripts like "The Death of RoC"), and `09_Investigation` (Active deep dives into geopolitical fraud networks).
- **Resource Domains**: `04_Investments` (FY2026 earnings for MSFT, Tesla, Meta, Blackberry), `05_Technology` (OpenClaw, Gemini Scribe, Web Dev/FastAPI, RAG systems), and `06_Accounts` (Logistics for OCBC, Stripe, and GCP billing).
- **Exploration & Archives**: `96_Explore` (Keyu Jin, Li Shuo, Gemini 3 Flash) and `97_OpenCode` (Coding agent skills ecosystem). `99_Archives` stores historical references (Liu Zhongjing, Qin Hui).

Notes frequently use dated filenames (e.g., `_2026年1月`) to maintain temporal context. The inclusion of `07_MOC` indicates a growing use of Maps of Content for navigation (e.g., OCBC), while folders like `97_OpenCode/Skills` and `skills/web-research` contain executable logic or documentation for AI agents. Physical environment setups (MacBook Air, Localhost) are managed in `08_Personal`.

## Key Topics

- **AI & Agents**: OpenCode ecosystem, PersonaPlex (iOS/Local/Real-time Voice), Agent Skills (Financial Analysis, YouTube Clipper, Web Research), Gemini 3 Flash, and Anthropic/Vertex AI SDK integration.
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Hybrid cloud deployment (**OpenClaw**), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Cloudflare, and NVIDIA Data Center GPU architecture (H100/B200 era).
- **Software Engineering**: Discord Bot Architecture (Heimdall), Python tooling (uv/uvx), WebSockets, FastAPI, and local RAG systems for investment research.
- **Investment & Finance**: FY2026 Earnings (Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Blackberry) and cross-border financial logistics (OCBC, Stripe/PayPal, CMBC Visa).
- **Geopolitics & Investigation**: US-China tech policy, Keyu Jin analysis, and the 2026 investigation into Myanmar fraud syndicates' migration to Dubai ("The Great Migration") using Agentic AI.
- **History & Philosophy**: Historical analysis (Liu Zhongjing, Qin Hui) and personal essays recorded in the "思想随笔" collection.

## User Preferences

Ray is a bilingual user (English/Chinese) who values high technical precision and structured data. The writing style is professional and analytical, often taking the form of "Research Reports," "Best Practices," "Architecture Deep Dives," or "Installation Guides."

There is a strong preference for actionable engineering advice (e.g., "How to configure X", "Architecture for Y") over theoretical discussions. Ray prefers notes that are explicitly dated to maintain context (specifically in the 2026 timeline). When assisting, adopt a professional, engineering-focused tone and be prepared to process information that mixes English technical terminology with Chinese analysis.

## Custom Instructions

- **Temporal Awareness**: The current context is early February 2026. Pay close attention to file suffixes like `_2026年1月`. Treat information from 2025 as historical context and 2026 data as current operational status.
- **Bilingual Context**: Seamlessly handle both English technical terms and Chinese analysis. Respond in Chinese unless specifically requested otherwise.
- **Agent Skills Handling**: The folders `97_OpenCode/Skills`, `04_Investments/skills`, and `skills/web-research` contain functional code or instructions for agents. Treat these as executable logic or reference implementations rather than standard prose notes.
- **Investment & Tech Focus**: When summarizing, prioritize "Actionable Insights," "Architecture Decisions," and "Logistical Solutions" (e.g., specific payment channels or cloud configurations).
- **Project Specifics**: When discussing AI deployment, refer to the **OpenClaw** (hybrid cloud/Canvas A2UI) and **PersonaPlex** (iOS/local RAG) contexts found in the vault for consistency.
- **Investigation Update (2026/02)**: Note the major shift of Myanmar fraud syndicates to **Dubai** ("The Great Migration") and their use of **Agentic AI** (WormGPT) and **Starlink** infrastructure.

# 2026 AI Ecosystem Update
- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's CLI-first tool for "Quality & Logic" and SaaS integration. Uses MCP Apps for interactive UIs.
- **Google Antigravity**: Google's AI-native IDE for "Speed & Depth" and local "Verification Loops".
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: The shared standard for tools/skills.
- **OpenCode Strategy**: The `97_OpenCode` folder serves as a shared skill repository for both platforms.
- **Hybrid Workflow**: Use Antigravity for building/coding, Claude Code for review/comms/docs.

- **Tool Ecosystem (2026)**: Established "Antigravity" (Google, IDE/Local/Factory) and "Claude Code" (Anthropic, CLI/SaaS/Manager) as the dual pillars of the development workflow.
- **Best Practices**: "Verification Loop" is key for Antigravity. "MCP Apps" are key for Claude Code.
- **Hybrid Workflow**: Use Antigravity for building/testing (The Hands) and Claude Code for architecture/comms (The Brain).
- **Tech Stack**: Flutter is the "Golden Path" for Antigravity due to strong typing and tooling; React Native requires Expo and careful rule management.
