## Summary

A common enterprise problem: crucial legacy systems become “black
      boxes”—key to operations but opaque and risky to touch. Thiyagu
      Palanisamy and Chandirasekar Thiagarajan worked with a
      client to use AI-assisted reverse engineering to reconstruct functional
      specifications from UI elements, binaries, and data lineage to overcome
      analysis paralysis. They developed a methodical “multi-lens”
      approach—starting from visible artifacts, enriching incrementally,
      triangulating logic, and always preserving lineage. Human validation
      remains central to ensure accuracy and confidence in extracted
      functionality. This engagement revealed that turning a system from black
      box to blueprint empowers modernization decisions and accelerates
      migration efforts.
