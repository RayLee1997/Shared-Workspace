## Summary

Why does AI write like… that (NYT, gift link). Sam Kriss delves into the quiet hum of AI writing. AI’s work is not compelling prose: it’s phantom text, ghostly scribblings, a spectre woven into our communal tapestry.
 ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄
Emily Bache has written a set of Test Desiderata, building on some earlier writing from Kent Beck. She lists the characteristics of good tests, and how they support her four “macro desiderata” - the properties of a sound test suite
Predict success in production
Fast to get feedback
Support ongoing code design change
Low total cost of ownership
She also has a great list of other writers’ lists of good test characteristics.

Daphne Keller explains that the EUs fines on X aren’t about free speech.
There are three charges against X, which all stem from a multi-year investigation that was launched in 2023. One is about verification — X’s blue checkmarks on user accounts — and two are about transparency. These charges have nothing to do with what content is on X, or what user speech the platform should or should not allow.

Cory Doctorow The Reverse-Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI
Start with what a reverse centaur is. In automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. … And obviously, a reverse centaur is machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.
Like an Amazon delivery driver… the van can’t drive itself and can’t get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance.
