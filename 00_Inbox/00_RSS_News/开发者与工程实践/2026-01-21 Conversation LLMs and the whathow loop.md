## Summary

A conversation between Unmesh Joshi, Rebecca
      Parsons, and Martin Fowler on how LLMs help us
      shape the abstractions in our software. We view our challenge as building
      systems that survive change, requiring us to manage our cognitive load. We
      can do this by mapping the “what” of we want our software to do into the
      “how” of programming languages. This “what” and “how” are built up in a
      feedback loop. TDD helps us operationalize that loop, and LLMs allow us to
      explore that loop in an informal and more fluid manner.
