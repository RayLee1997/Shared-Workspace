## Summary

CLI coding agents are a fundamentally different tool to chatbots or
      autocomplete tools - they're agents that can read code, run tests, and
      update a codebase. Ben O'Mahony explains that while
      commercial tools are impressive, they don't understand the particular
      context of our environment and the eccentricities of our specific project.
      Instead we can build our own coding agent by assembling open source tools,
      using our specific development standards for: testing, documentation
      production, code reasoning, and file system operations.
