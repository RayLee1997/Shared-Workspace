## Summary

The Bahmni open-source hospital management system was began over nine
      years ago with a front end using AngularJS and an OpenMRS REST API.
      Rahul Ramesh wished to convert this to use a React +
      TypeScript front end with an HL7 FHIR API. In exploring how to do this
      modernization he used a structured prompting workflow of Research, Review,
      and Rebuild - together with Cline, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Atlassian MCP
      server, and a filesystem MCP server. Changing a single control would
      normally take 3–6 days of manual effort, but with these tools was
      completed in under an hour at a cost of under $2.
