## Summary

OKRs have become a popular way to connect strategy with execution in
      large organizations. But when they are set in a top‑down cascade, they
      often lose their meaning. Teams receive objectives they didn’t help
      create, and the result is weak commitment and little real change.
      Paulo Caroli describes how 
      high‑performing teams can work in another way. They define their own
      objectives in an organization that uses a collaborative process to align
      the team’s OKRs with the broader strategy. With these Team OKRs in place,
      they create a shared purpose and become the base for a regular cycle of
      planning, check‑ins, and retrospectives.
