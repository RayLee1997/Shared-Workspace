## Summary

Service templates are a typical building block in the “golden paths”
      organisations build for their engineering teams, to make it easy to do the
      right thing. The templates are supposed to be the role models for all the
      services in the organisation, always representing the most up to date
      coding patterns and standards. One of the challenges with service
      templates though is that once a team instantiated a service with one, it’s
      tedious to feed template updates back to those services. Birgitta
      Böckeler considers whether GenAI can help
      with that.
