## Summary

Super Bowl LX is nearly here, with the Seattle Seahawks taking on the New England Patriots. While Bad Bunny will be the star of the halftime show, AI could be the star of the commercial breaks, much like crypto was a few years ago.
Last year’s Super Bowl featured a Google Gemini ad that fumbled a Gouda cheese stat, and this year’s game is already slated to include an ad for Anthropic’s AI platform that takes jabs at its competitors, namely OpenAI. AI-generated ads could make an appearance, too. 
Super Bowl LX is set to kick off at 6:30PM ET/3:30PM PT on Sunday, February 8th at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. 
Gemini becomes an AI interior decorator in Google’s Super Bowl ad.
			
From Crypto.com to AI.com.
			
Alexa Plus tries to kill Chris Hemsworth in Amazon’s Super Bowl ad.
			
Sam Altman responds to Anthropic’s ‘funny’ Super Bowl ads
			
Anthropic’s first Super Bowl ad dunks on ChatGPT.
			
Don’t expect any Kalshi or Polymarket ads during the Super Bowl.
