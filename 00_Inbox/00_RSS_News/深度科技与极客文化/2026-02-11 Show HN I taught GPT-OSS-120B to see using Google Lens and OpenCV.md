## Summary

I built an MCP server that gives any local LLM real Google search and now vision capabilities - no API keys needed.
  The latest feature: google_lens_detect uses OpenCV to find objects in an image, crops each one, and sends them to Google Lens for identification. GPT-OSS-120B, a text-only model with
   zero vision support, correctly identified an NVIDIA DGX Spark and a SanDisk USB drive from a desk photo.

  Also includes Google Search, News, Shopping, Scholar, Maps, Finance, Weather, Flights, Hotels, Translate, Images, Trends, and more. 17 tools total.

  Two commands: pip install noapi-google-search-mcp && playwright install chromium

  PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/noapi-google-search-mcp/
