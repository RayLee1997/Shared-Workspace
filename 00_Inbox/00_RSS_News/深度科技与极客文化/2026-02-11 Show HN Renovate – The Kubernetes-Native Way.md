## Summary

Hey folks, we built a Kubernetes operator for Renovate and wanted to share it. Instead of running Renovate as a cron job or relying on hosted services, this operator lets you manage it as a native Kubernetes resource with CRDs. You define your repos and config declaratively, and the operator handles scheduling and execution inside your cluster. No external dependencies, no SaaS lock-in, no webhook setup. The whole thing is open source and will stay that way – there's no paid tier or monetization plan behind it, we just needed this ourselves and figured others might too.
Would love to hear feedback or ideas if you give it a try: https://github.com/mogenius/renovate-operator
