## Summary

Strap in, because the next PlayStation event is going to be a long one. Sony’s latest State of Play — a showcase event for upcoming PS5 games — kicks off on February 12th at 5PM ET and it’ll last more than an hour.
We don’t know what exactly will be shown. Sony says that the event will include “news, gameplay updates, and announcements from game studios across the globe.” However, it sounds like one of the biggest upcoming PS5 games, Insomniac’s bloody take on Wolverine, might not make an appearance. Most likely the event will feature a mixture of some of Sony’s tentpole single-player experiences from studios like Naughty Dog, along with its continued (albeit scaled back) push into live-service games through upcoming titles like Horizon Hunters Gathering and Bungie’s return to Marathon.
You can watch the event live on both Twitch and YouTube, and stay tuned here for all of the most important and interesting reveals and announcements.
