## Summary

Violet Jira, reporting for NOTUS:
The White House communications team posted a digitally altered
photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minnesota social
justice activist, on Thursday that makes it appear that she was
weeping during her arrest by federal agents.
The image is highly realistic, bearing no watermark or other
indicator that the image has been doctored. The change is only
apparent when compared to a different version of the same image
posted by the Department of Homeland Security earlier in
the day.
The White House, which has adopted a combative, flippant tone on
its widely viewed social media pages, drew some backlash for the
post online. In response, White House deputy communications
director Kaelan Dorr called the image a “meme.”
It’s not a meme. It’s propaganda — an altogether false image presented as an actual photograph.
