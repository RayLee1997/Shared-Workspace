## Summary

I created a site (https://printableclassics.com) that allows you to download classic books and customize things like the font size, page size, and the cover.
As part of this, I wrote a software pipeline that takes epubs, html files, or pdfs and converts them into formatted books with custom covers, page numbers, chapter formatting, etc.
I used an LLM for categorizing the books. There's a nice way to filter such that you could easily find "Young Adult, Ancient, Fantasy" for example.
When downloading from the site, the PDFS are rendered in a work queue. Hopefully the server I'm using won't get overwhelmed. It takes around 10-15 seconds to generate for most books.
Most of the books currently on the site are from Standard Ebooks. I plan to add more books from Archive.org and Project Gutenberg over time.
I also created a little guide on how you can print and bind books at home with around $200 in equipment. (https://printableclassics.com/print-guide)
Printable versions of the Harvard Classics are available here: https://printableclassics.com/harvard_classics This is an example of direct PDF conversion.
Hopefully this is useful to some people. I plan to use the books here for home education myself so it will at least be useful to me. I'd like to add a guide with top suggestions by age level and some educational theory on how I made the selections. I'm happy to take any feedback on the site or answer any questions.
There is also the option to have the books professionally printed through a print on demand provider. I'm hoping that could be a way to pay for the site hosting.
Thanks for checking it out!
