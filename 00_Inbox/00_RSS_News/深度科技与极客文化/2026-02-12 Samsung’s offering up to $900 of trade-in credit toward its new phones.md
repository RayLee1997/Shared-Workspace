## Summary

Samsung’s next Unpacked event is happening on February 25th, and we anticipate the company will announce the Galaxy S26 lineup of phones. There may be some new wearables and earbuds announced, too. In addition to the showing off the new hardware, Galaxy AI software is likely to be a big part of the show, since that’s the focus of the Unpacked sizzle reel.
If you’re hyped for the new devices — enough to consider trading in your phone — Samsung is hosting some special trade-in perks, but only if you register interest in a preorder ahead of the event and follow through with a purchase after the unveiling later this month. Registering through Samsung’s site or its Shop Samsung app now will unlock a $30 use-it-or-lose-it credit that can be applied toward accessories at preorder. However, it can’t be used to reduce the cost of the new device.
The company is also offering up to $900 in trade-in value for your phone if you preorder one of its new phones in the same transaction. This amount is higher than its current values, which go up to $700 if you have an S24 Ultra to trade. Regardless of the make or model, your old phone needs to meet some eligibility requirements, including (but not limited to) that it can’t have damage beyond normal wear-and-tear. The anticipated trade-in value will be applied at checkout. Whether you’re set on trading your phone in or not, it might be worth checking out Samsung’s site once preorders launch just to entertain the company’s trade-in offer.
