## Summary

Deals have been admittedly pretty dry since the holidays, but now that February is in full swing, we’re starting to see strong discounts return across a range of categories. In fact, thanks to Valentine’s Day, the Super Bowl, and — as of this week — Presidents Day, retailers are once again offering a slew of notable tech deals, making now a great time to shop if you’ve been holding off on making a larger purchase.
Although the Super Bowl has technically come and gone, plenty of game-day discounts are still around. A few have been rebranded for Presidents Day — including the discounts we recently saw on Sonos soundbars and speakers — but others are part of a new wave of limited-time deals, letting you save on OLED TVs, wireless earbuds, iPads, and other gadgets through the end of Monday, February 16th.
Below, we’ve rounded up the best Presidents Day deals we’ve seen so far. As in previous years, we’ll continue updating this list with new picks as we approach the long weekend and ensuing holiday.
Headphone and earbud deals
Shokz OpenFit Air
The OpenFit Air feature a lightweight, open-ear design that allows you to remain aware of your surroundings. They’re well-suited for everyday use and the gym thanks to their IP55 water resistance rating, and feature relatively clear sound and a decent amount of bass despite their open build. Read our review.

Where to Buy:

 $119.95 $79.95 at Amazon
 $119.95 $79.99 at Best Buy
 $119.95 $79.99 at Target

You can currently buy the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus at Best Buy for $149.99 ($50 off), which is just $10 more than their all-time low. The open-style earbuds boast wireless charging and support for Dolby Audio, but are otherwise nearly identical to the Shokz OpenFit 2, with one dedicated bass speaker and another for mids and highs. They don’t sound as clear as the OpenRun Pro 2, but they do sound better than the OpenFit Air and offer helpful onboard touch controls.
The latest pair of AirPods Max are on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart for $449.99 ($100 off), which is $50 shy of their best price to date. Apple’s stainless steel / aluminum headphones offer a high-end look few headphones can match, along with a natural-sounding transparency mode and some of the best noise cancellation available. They also play well with other Apple devices, providing Apple users access to automatic device switching, head-tracking spatial audio, built-in Find My support, and other notable features. Read our original review.
Beats Studio Pro
The latest Beats Studio Pro feature improved noise cancellation, sound quality, and comfort. They also support lossless audio over USB-C, making them the first Apple headphones to do so. Read our review.

 $349.99 $169.99 at Best Buy

The OpenRun Pro 2 are Shokz’s best bone conduction headphones yet, with better sound and more bass than their predecessor. Our reviewer Victoria Song praised their cozy fit as well as their USB-C charging (goodbye, proprietary charger!). Read our review.

Where to Buy:

 $179.95 $149.95 at Amazon
 $179.95 $149.99 at REI
 $179.95 $149.99 at Best Buy

The Sonos Ace are currently available in black from Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos for $319 ($80 off), which is the best price we’ve seen since they dropped to $249 in December. Sonos’ first pair of headphones deliver great ANC and sound, but what really makes them stand out is that you can easily swap TV audio from a compatible Sonos soundbar to your headphones for private listening. Read our review.
You can buy a pair of the noise-canceling AirPods Pro 3 for $209.99 ($40 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, which is about $10 more than their most recent sale price. Apple’s premium earbuds boast the best ANC and sound quality of any AirPods to date, along with a built-in heart-rate sensor that allows you to use them as a fitness tracker. The wireless earbuds also improve upon the prior model with an additional ear tip size (XXS) and a more robust IP57 rating for sweat and water resistance. Read our review.
Speaker deals
Sonos Era 100
Sonos’ Era 100 smart speaker is a replacement for the older Sonos One, utilizing two tweeters (left and right) and one larger woofer. In addition to Wi-Fi, the Era 100 also supports Bluetooth audio and line-in playback via an optional 3.5mm to USB-C adapter.

Where to Buy:

 $219 $179 at Amazon
 $219 $179 at Sonos
 $219 $179.99 at Best Buy

The Sonos Era 300 is also on sale for $379 ($100 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Sonos, which is $20 shy of its best price to date. The fantastic smart speaker delivers more powerful, Dolby Atmos-enabled sound than the Era 100, allowing for room-filling spatial audio. It also supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and line-in audio via USB-C (with Sonos’ optional adapter), as well as voice controls via Amazon Alexa. Read our review.
JBL Authentics 200
The JBL Authentics 200 is one of the first smart speakers with simultaneous Google Assistant and Alexa support. The small, ‘70s-style speaker produces great sound for its size, and you don’t need to toggle a setting to use your preferred virtual assistant.

Where to Buy:

 $349.95 $199.95 at Amazon
 $349.99 $199.95 at Best Buy

You can buy the JBL Charge 6 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart for $159.95 ($40 off), which is $10 shy of its lowest price to date. The rugged Bluetooth speaker builds on its predecessor with improved sound, a more robust IP68 water resistance rating, and up to 28 hours of continuous playback on a single charge. It also supports lossless audio with compatible services like Spotify, and features a removable strap so you can carry it around easily. As an added bonus, it even doubles as a power bank.
The tiny JBL Clip 5 is available from Amazon, Best Buy, and JBL for $59.95 ($20 off), which is $10 more than its best-ever price. The Clip 5 offers up to 12 hours of battery life on a single charge while delivering surprisingly powerful sound for its size, which you can adjust using JBL’s companion app. It also features an IP67 rating and a built-in carabiner, so you can clip it to your bag, handlebars, or anything else you can latch it to.
Soundbar, TV, and streaming deals
Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus
The latest version of Amazon’s zippy Fire TV Stick 4K streams in 4K resolution, as its name suggests, and features support for Wi-Fi 6, Dolby Atmos / Vision, and HDR10 Plus.

Where to Buy:

 $49.99 $29.99 at Amazon
 $49.99 $29.99 at Best Buy


LG B5 OLED TV
LG’s budget B5 is a great way to get OLED picture quality for less. It features support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, along with a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports for hooking up the latest gaming consoles. It also runs LG’s webOS platform, supports Amazon Alexa, and provides easy access to a wide range of popular streaming apps.

Where to Buy:

 $1299.99 $599.99 at Best Buy (48-inch)


LG C5 OLED TV
LG’s midrange C5 TV is an excellent way to get OLED performance without paying top dollar. It has a good amount of brightness, excellent color accuracy out of the box, and great gaming features, including a max 144Hz refresh rate.

Where to Buy:

 $1999.99 $1046.99 at Amazon (55-inch)
 $1999.99 $1199.99 at LG (55-inch)

The high-end G5 OLED TV is matching its best price at Amazon, where you can buy it for $1,996.99 ($1,403 off) right now. Other configurations are on sale too, with the 83-inch model going for about $5,299.99 ($1,200 off) at Amazon and LG’s online storefront (where you’ll also receive $200 off one of several soundbars). LG’s step-up OLED offers all the features of the midrange C5, but it’s noticeably brighter, with a higher maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. It also features a more powerful chip, enabling better image processing and upscaling, so lower-res content looks sharper and more detailed.
If you’re looking for a high-end soundbar, the Sonos Arc Ultra is down to $899 ($200 off) — $20 shy of its best-ever price — at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos’ online storefront. The Arc Ultra is more powerful than the Beam and better suited for larger spaces, largely thanks to its upward-firing Dolby Atmos drivers, which help create a more immersive, theater-like experience.  It also builds on the last-gen model with Bluetooth support, deeper bass response, and clearer, more defined dialogue.

You can also pair it with select gym equipment via Bluetooth and get turn-by-turn directions via Google Maps. Read our review.

The second-gen Blink Mini is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $23.99 ($16 off), or just $6 more than its lowest price to date. The basic 1080p security camera is a solid pick if you want an affordable way to keep an eye on your home. It offers improved video and audio quality over its predecessor, along with USB-C power and a wider field of view, while still providing essential features like two-way audio, motion alerts, and an adjustable design.

As part of eBay’s ongoing Presidents Day sale, you can grab a refurbished Eufy X10 Pro Omni with a two-year warranty for $279.99 (which is $620 less than buying it new) using code LONGWKND20. The X10 Pro Omni is a powerful robot vacuum / mop hybrid, with dual oscillating brushes and 8,000Pa of suction. Its all-in-one dock can automatically empty the dustbin, refill the water tank, and dry the mop pads, while the onboard water reservoir lets it clean for longer stretches before needing to dock.

Read our review.
The Dyson Airwrap i.d. is available for $499.99 ($150 off) from Best Buy and Dyson.
