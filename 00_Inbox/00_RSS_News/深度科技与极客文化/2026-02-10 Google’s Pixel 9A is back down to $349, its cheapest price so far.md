## Summary

The Pixel 9A is an incredible phone that’s worth hopping on while it’s $349 for the 128GB version in blue, black, or pink at Amazon and Best Buy. It’s discounted ahead of the new Pixel 10A, for which Google will open pre-orders on February 18. That’s also when the company will share more details regarding specs and price for the midrange phone. 
Google Pixel 9A
The Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone. Read our review.

Where to Buy:

 $499 $349 at Amazon
 $499 $349 at Best Buy
 $499 $399 at Google

Even at its original $499 price, our reviewer Allison Johnson felt that what you got for the money was just right. The Pixel 9A is an especially great value at this sale price. It has an IP68 rating, seven years of software updates, a larger, brighter screen than the Pixel 8A, plus wireless charging and a 120Hz refresh rate.

Tomtoc’s hard zip-up case for the Nintendo Switch 2 is the best one out there, with a slim, minimalist look available in multiple colors, a sleeve for storing 12 game cartridges, and occasionally a competitive price. You can get the lowest price that we’ve seen on select colors, including black, grey, white, and its matcha green gradient option for around $24 (originally $36.99) at Amazon when you enter the code YX2SATAXQVMO at checkout. It’s the only case that I’ve tested that includes some padding near the top of the Switch 2 system to keep it from moving around in the event of a drop. Here’s my buying guide covering this and other great Switch 2 cases.
Ethernet switches don’t have to cost you a lot of money. My needs are met by this eight-port TP-Link gigabit switch that’s under $20. However, it’s possible that you’re you’re paying a lot for fast internet service and you really want to make sure you’re getting your money’s worth. If that’s the case, Netgear’s five-port switch, which supports up to 2.5-gigabit connections, is back to its lowest price at Amazon, costing $69.99. Outside this discount, which has only happened once before during January, it costs $99.99.
Woot has a nice deal on a new AMD Ryzen 9 7900X desktop processor. The 2022 CPU typically costs $350 at most retailers, but you can purchase it for $239.99 while supplies last. It’s a great deal if you’re assembling a capable gaming PC while trying to save as much money as possible. This processor must be paired with a motherboard that has an AM5 socket. Unlike Intel’s strategy of shifting sockets every couple of generations, AM5 is still being used by AMD processors. In other words, you can upgrade later to an 8000 or 9000-series CPU without having to completely uproot your build.
