## Summary

Sol LeWitt was a conceptual artist who never touched his own walls.
He wrote instructions and other people executed them, the original prompt engineer!
I bookmarked a project called "Solving Sol" seven years ago and made a repo in 2018. Committed a README. Never pushed anything else.
Fast forward to 2026, I finally built it.
