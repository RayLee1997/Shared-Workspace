## Summary

Example repo: https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezydemo
The underlying ESP-IDF component: https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezybox
It is something like Raspberry Pi, but without the overhead of a full server-grade OS.
It captures a lot of the old school DOS era coding experience. I created a custom fast text mode driver, plan to add VGA-like graphics next. ANSI text demos run smooth, as you can see in the demo video featured in the Readme.
App installs also work smoothly. The first time it installed 6 apps from my git repo with one command, felt like, "OMG, I got homebrew to run on a toaster!" And best of all, it can install from any repo, no approvals or waiting, you just publish a compatible ELF file in your release.
