## Summary

Bridger Beal-Cvetko and Daniel Woodruff, reporting for KSL News:
SB138, sponsored by Cullimore, R-Sandy, would make Android, the
world’s most popular mobile device operating system, an official
state symbol, joining the ranks of the official state cooking pot
(the dutch oven), the official state crustacean (the brine
shrimp), and the official state mushroom (the porcini).
“Someday, everybody with an iPhone will realize that the
technology is better on Android,” Cullimore told reporters during
a media availability on Wednesday, the second day of the
legislative session.
But, he added, “I’m the only one in my family — all my kids, my
wife, they all have iPhones — but I’m holding strong.” [...]
“I don’t expect this to really get out of committee,” he said.
