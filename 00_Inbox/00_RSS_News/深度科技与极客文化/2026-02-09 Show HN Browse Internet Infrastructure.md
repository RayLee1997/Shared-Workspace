## Summary

I'm launching Wirewiki.com today!
Wirewiki makes the internet’s hidden infrastructure browsable.
I quit my job 5 years ago to scale Nslookup.io. But after reaching 600k monthly users, I hit a ceiling. I couldn't naturally expand beyond DNS because of the domain name.
So I went back to the drawing board: how would I make it today? Not as a collection of tools, but as a browsable graph.
I've spent hundreds of hours and commits building that. It's not even at 10% of what I want it to be, but more than enough to be useful, and (in my biased opinion) much better than what's out there.
Wirewiki launches with DNS lookup, propagation, zone transfer and SPF checking. It also scans the entire IPv4 space for DNS servers and indexes them.
I'm working on adding more data and tools.
I feel like I've developed tunnel vision, so if you see anything that feels off, let me know!
I'll keep Wirewiki open and free. Once it has a substantial amount of users, I'll open it up to sponsorship / brand integration from hosting providers, registrars and CDNs, as users will likely be in the market for those. But my goal is to keep Wirewiki free from display ads. I'm confident that's viable.
