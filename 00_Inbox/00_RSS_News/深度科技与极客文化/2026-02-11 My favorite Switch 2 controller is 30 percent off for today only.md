## Summary

The EasySMX S10 is a fantastic wireless controller for the Switch 2 that offers nearly as many features as Nintendo’s $90 gamepad. I ranked it as the best Switch 2 controller you can buy, thanks to its satisfying rumble sensation in games, support for motion controls as well as Nintendo’s amiibo NFC figures, plus the ability to remotely wake your console. Not to mention, it has durable TMR joysticks that are designed to last a lot longer than the hardware used by Nintendo in its controller. 
I think it’s worth considering even at its original $59.99, but it’s considerably cheaper for the rest of the day at Amazon. You can get the black version for $41.99, and the blue and white version is $44.99.
EasySMX S10 Gaming Controller for Switch 2

Where to Buy:

 $59.99 $41.99 at Amazon (black)
 $59.99 at EasySMX
 $59.99 at Walmart

I’d wager that most people aren’t willing to spend $89.99 on Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro controller. Even for those who have the cash to splash, the S10 proves to be just as comfortable to use, even during long gaming sessions. Aside from lacking the Switch 2 Pro’s 3.5mm headphone jack that’s used for private listening, this controller is functionally identical. My biggest issue with the S10 is that the Screenshot, GameChat, and Home button placement is cramped, leading to some accidental presses. But at this price, it’s easier to overlook a small design flaw.
