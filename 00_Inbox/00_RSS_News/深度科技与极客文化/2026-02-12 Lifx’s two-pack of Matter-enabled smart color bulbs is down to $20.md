## Summary

Let’s give it up for companies that are making affordable smart bulbs. Lifx is one, having recently released a two-pack of A19 / E26 LED bulbs at CES 2026 capable of white and color for just $24.99. These dimmable 800-lumen bulbs connect over Wi-Fi, and they’re compatible with Matter, making them work seamlessly with numerous smart home platforms. While their original price was already compelling, they’re now $19.99 at Amazon, which is their lowest price yet — just $10 per bulb. For perspective, a similar two-pack of color-changing Philips Hue bulbs currently costs $71.99.

Where to Buy:

 $24.99 $19.99 at Amazon

The setup process is simple, whether you have a preexisting smart home platform at work in your home or not. The bulbs can connect to Google Home, Alexa, Apple Home, SmartThings ecosystems, or you can set them up within Lifx’s mobile app. Otherwise, the only requirement is 2.4GHz connectivity through your Wi-Fi router.
Other Verge-approved deals happening now
After a month or so of selling at their original $449 price, Sony’s WH-1000XM6 over-ear headphones have returned once again to their lowest price yet of $398 at Amazon and Best Buy. These feature better sound and better active noise cancellation than the last-gen model. One of the biggest improvements over the XM5, depending on who you ask, is the XM6’s return to being foldable. The ear cups can swivel and fold upward into the headband, making them more compact to bring around than the last-gen model. This flexibility was previously seen in the XM4 model, so it’s great to have it back in Sony’s best headphones yet. Read our hands-on impressions.
Through February 16th, you can get a 55-inch Panasonic Z85 OLED TV for $638.39 (originally $1,599, but it normally sells for around $800) before tax at eBay. It’s being sold by BuyDig, which has very positive ratings as a seller, and it’s notably cheaper on eBay than at Amazon, where it costs $697.99 (also through a third-party seller). Enter the code LONGWKND20 at checkout if it doesn’t apply automatically. We haven’t reviewed this model, but its specs and size seem great for the price. It features Amazon’s Fire TV software, up to 120Hz refresh rate at 4K, and the same great perks that OLED delivers in any TV. That includes per-pixel color and lighting accuracy, unparalleled viewing angles, and superb contrast. Ratings site RTINGS notes that this TV’s performance is roughly on-par with the LG B4, falling below the more advanced C4 in terms of brightness and how it handles reflections.
Oakley’s Meta HSTN glasses are more polarizing than the regular Meta Ray-Ban glasses, but its least divisive color scheme is cheaper than ever right now at Amazon. The black frame glasses with clear lenses are $339.15, down from $399. If you want to stand out from the crowd, the model with a white frame and Oakley’s Prizm ruby lenses are selling at the same price. Our reviewer Victoria Song considers the Ray-Bans to be a better value at the HSTN’s original price, but there are some perks here that you won’t get with the plainer smart glasses. For instance, they pack in longer battery life, they shoot video at a higher resolution, and Oakley’s Prizm lenses make greenery look more green, which is never a bad thing. Read our review.
