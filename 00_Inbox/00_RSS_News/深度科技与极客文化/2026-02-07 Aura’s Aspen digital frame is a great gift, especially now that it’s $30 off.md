## Summary

The Aura Aspen is a sweet and sentimental gift that’s $199. | Image: Aura	

Aura’s Aspen digital photo frame is a great Valentine’s Day gift if you want something that’s slick and sentimental, and right now it’s on sale for $199 ($30 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Aura’s online storefront. That’s the lowest we’ve seen the frame sell for since the holidays.
Aura Aspen

Where to Buy:

 $229 $199 at Amazon
 $229 $199 at Aura
 $229.99 $199.99 at Best Buy

With its paper-textured, antiglare matte display and adjustable metal stand, the 12-inch Aspen looks remarkably similar to a classic picture frame. It lets you upload and share photos from anywhere. It also has features that help photos feel more personal, like a sharp 1600 x 1200 HD LCD panel that makes images appear lifelike and can display Live Photos, as well as short 30-second video clips. You can even add text captions.
There are other reasons we like Aspen, too. The frame adapts to a room’s lighting, and its 4:3 aspect ratio matches most smartphone cameras, so photos fill the screen naturally without awkward formatting. Plus, unlike many rivals, Aura doesn’t charge a subscription fee for cloud storage, so you don’t have to worry about giving a gift that comes with extra costs.

Three more Verge-approved deals
The last-gen AirTag is on sale for $17 ($12 off) at Amazon and Walmart, which is its best price to date. The tracker remains an excellent option for keeping tabs on your items if you’re an iPhone owner. It combines Apple’s ​​Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip with Apple’s wide Find My network for tracking that still outperforms most rivals, even if the AirTag 2 may be louder and more precise with its second-gen chip. Plus, you get a user-replaceable battery and access to the same software features, including the ability to share an AirTag’s location with up to five other people.
The Kobo Libra Colour is my favorite Kindle alternative, and right now you can grab it for $209.99 ($20 off) from Rakuten Kobo and Target, which is $10 shy of its best price to date. It’s a terrific alternative to the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, offering a seven-inch color screen that’s slightly less vibrant but still easy on the eyes. It’s waterproof like the Colorsoft, charges via USB-C, and adds extra perks like physical page-turn buttons and stylus support for jotting down notes. Read our review.
You can buy the Epicka Universal Travel Adapter starting at $15.99 ($7 off) at Amazon, which is its cheapest price yet. The adapter comes with four different plugs that cover more than 200 countries across Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia. It also features four USB-A ports, a single USB-C port, and one AC socket, so you can charge up to six devices, including smartphones, laptops, cameras, and more.
