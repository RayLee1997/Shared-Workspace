## Summary

Two clip-paths, over the navigation:
- The first clip-path is a circle (top-left corner)
- The second clip-path is a polygon, that acts like a ray (hardcoded, can be improved)
The original work by Iventions Events https://iventions.com/ uses JavaScript, but I found CSS-only approach more fun
Here's a demo and the codebase: https://github.com/Momciloo/fun-with-clip-path
