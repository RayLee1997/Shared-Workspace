# Writing Language Rule

Writing is strictly **bilingual**:

- **English** for: technical specifications, code, architectural definitions, API documentation, and implementation details
- **Chinese** for: synthesis, essays, geopolitical analysis, investment strategy, and nuanced commentary

The user values content that bridges high-level strategy (Investment/Geopolitics) with low-level code implementation (Antigravity/OpenCode). Technical terms should remain in English even within Chinese text.
