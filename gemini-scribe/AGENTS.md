This file provides context about this Obsidian vault for AI agents.

## Vault Overview

This vault functions as the **2026 Command Center** for Ray, a bilingual senior engineer and investor. It operates as a high-throughput intelligence pipeline, ingesting massive amounts of data via `00_Inbox` (over 700 RSS items) to drive three core outputs: **Local-First AI Software** (SimpleRSS, OpenClaw), **Strategic Investments** ($1M Portfolio, AI Bubble analysis), and **Geopolitical Deep Dives** (Myanmar fraud, Epstein network).

The workspace adheres to a strict **"Constraint-Driven" philosophy**: executing cutting-edge AI workflows (Google Antigravity, Local RAG) on legacy hardware (MacBook Air 2017) with a capped budget. This forces a preference for optimization, "Pitfall Logs" (debugging guides), and the Google Antigravity ecosystem over expensive SaaS alternatives.

## Organization

The vault follows a modified Johnny Decimal system (00-99) tailored for an AI-augmented workflow. Note that the structure has evolved from previous iterations:

- **Input & Production (00-03)**: `00_Inbox` is the active pulse, containing the massive `00_RSS_News` archive and `00_News_Brief` synthesis. `01_Research` covers specific deep dives (OWID, Discord bots). `02_Ideas` holds thoughts and history. `03_Productions` manages active software projects like **SimpleRSS** and **"the Death of RoC"**.
- **Knowledge Core (04-05)**: `04_Investments` tracks the 2026 Portfolio, Macro history, and company watchlists (PLTR, TSLA, OpenAI). `05_Technology` is the engineering bible, housing **Agents** (OpenCode), the **Antigravity** ecosystem, **OpenClaw** architecture, and tool guides (FastMCP, Cloudflare).
- **Operations & Investigation (06-09)**: `06_Accounts` manages global logistics (GCP, OCBC). `07_Investigation` (previously 09) tracks dark geopolitics, specifically the "Myanmar to Dubai" fraud migration and AI bubble research. `08_Personal` handles local configs. `09_MOC` serves as the home entry point.
- **Exploration (11, 99)**: `11_Explore` serves as a knowledge graph for key figures (Jinkeyu, LiShuo) and study topics. `99_Archives` holds historical context.

## Key Topics

- **Google Antigravity vs. Claude Code**: The "IDE War" defining the development environment, with a strong bias toward Antigravity for local execution.
- **Local-First AI on Legacy Hardware**: Engineering constraints for running RAG and `uv/uvx` tools on a MacBook Air 2017, focusing on factory resets and environment optimization.
- **Strategic Investment**: 2026 Portfolio planning focused on the **SpaceX/xAI Merger**, the **AI Bubble** investigation, and specific watchlists (BlackBerry, Palantir).
- **Geopolitical Analysis**: Tracking the migration of underground industries (Myanmar to Dubai), Epstein networks, and Japan's Right Wing rise.
- **OpenClaw & Canvas UI**: Web engineering focused on Canvas-based UI, WebSocket integration, and mixed-cloud deployment.
- **RSS Intelligence**: The evolution of RSS in the AI age, specifically the **SimpleRSS** project and Gemini integration.

## User Preferences

Ray embodies the **"Pragmatic Engineer"** persona. He prioritizes **comparative analysis** and **cost-efficiency**. He is skeptical of hype (evidenced by the "AI Bubble" investigation) and prefers **"Pitfall Logs" (踩坑记)**—notes that document failure points and debugging steps—over generic tutorials.

Writing is strictly **bilingual**: **English** for technical specifications, code, and architectural definitions; **Chinese** for synthesis, essays, geopolitical analysis, and nuance. The user values content that bridges the gap between high-level strategy (Investment/Geopolitics) and low-level code implementation.

## Custom Instructions

- **Temporal Context**: Today is **February 13, 2026**. The `00_Inbox/00_RSS_News` folder is the active "pulse". Prioritize the recent Feb 2026 files for context.
- **Folder Structure Awareness**: Note that **OpenCode** is currently located in `05_Technology/Agents/OpenCode`, and **Investigation** is in `07_Investigation`. Do not refer to obsolete sector mappings.
- **Tool Distinctions**: Maintain the distinction between **Google Antigravity** (preferred/local) and **Claude Code** (logic/SaaS).
- **Geopolitical Sensitivity**: Contextualize fraud or regional security topics with the "Myanmar to Dubai" narrative found in `07_Investigation`.
